# Modular Aircraft System Simulation

Saab Aeronautics has chosen Modelica and Dymola as part of the means for modelo based system engineering (MBSE). Public Domain Aeronautical Software (PDAS) refers to software programs and tools that are developed, maintained, and distributed under public licenses. QPlane is a fixed wing flight simulation environment for reinforcement learning. MakerPlane is a volunteer-driven open-source aviation organization focused on making affordable avionics and resources more accessible to the experimental aviation community. Code_aster is a nonlinear finite element solver for structures and thermomechanics. A FreeCAD workbench dedicated to Airplane Design. pyBADA provides aircraft performance modelling, trajectory prediction and optimisation, and visualisation with BADA in Python. TRANsient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models. A Dymola library for modeling thermal hydraulic energy systems and other multi-physics systems. The Rotorcraft Aerodynamics Library is a Modelica library for supporting the analysis and design of current and future rotorcraft. HanserModelica is a Modelica open source educational library on object oriented modeling applied to electrical engineering and a particular focus on polyphase electric machines. The 40KG Forced Turbojet Engine is a cutting-edge micro gas turbine producing 40 kilograms of thrust in a compact form factor. PyEfis is an Electronic Flight Information System written in Python. ExperimentalAvionics EFIS AHRS is an attitude and heading reference system module. The Core Flight System (cFS) is a reusable, mission-independent flight software package consisting of an Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL), a Platform Support Package (PSP), the Central Flight Executive (cFE), cFS libraries, and cFS applications.
 
The directory structure includes a specific folder for each phase of development and engineering programs:

CAD: For computer-aided design.
CAM: Dedicated to the part manufacturing and assembly process.
CAS: For simulation of end-to-end functionality and performance analysis.

# Modular Jet Aircraft Simulator

 Saab Aeronautics has chosen Modelica and Dymola as part of the means for modelo based system engineering (MBSE). Modelon offers systems modeling and simulation software that accelerates product innovation, development, and operations in a range of industries. MakerPlane is a volunteer-driven open-source aviation organization focused on making affordable avionics and resources more accessible to the experimental aviation community. A FreeCAD workbench dedicated to Airplane Design. pyBADA provides aircraft performance modelling, trajectory prediction and optimisation, and visualisation with BADA in Python. TRANsient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models. A Dymola library for modeling thermal hydraulic energy systems and other multi-physics systems. The Rotorcraft Aerodynamics Library is a Modelica library for supporting the analysis and design of current and future rotorcraft. HanserModelica is a Modelica open source educational library on object oriented modeling applied to electrical engineering and a particular focus on polyphase electric machines. The 40KG Forced Turbojet Engine is a cutting-edge micro gas turbine producing 40 kilograms of thrust in a compact form factor. The Bede BD-5 Micro is a series of small, single-seat homebuilt aircraft. The BD-5 has a small, streamlined fuselage holding its semi-reclined pilot under a large canopy, with the engine installed in a compartment in the middle of the fuselage, and a propeller-driving engine – or jet engine in the BD-5J variant – mounted immediately to the rear of the cockpit. The Tomark Viper SD4 is a Slovak single–engine, all-metal, two-seat low wing monoplane. The Viper Aircraft ViperJet is a small homebuilt jet aircraft. The IAI Lavi (Hebrew: לביא, "lion") is a single-engined fourth-generation multirole jet fighter developed in Israel, by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), during the 1980s
